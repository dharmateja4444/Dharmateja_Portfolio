# [Project 1: Twitter Sentiment Analysis for cryptocurrency(Ethereum)](https://github.com/dharmateja4444/Twittersentimentianalyis-/blob/main/Dashboard.ipynb)

 This is a follow-up to my previous post about my dissertation at the University of Leicester on the project Twitter sentiment analysis on #cryptocurrency. I have been very exciting to work on trending technology like cryptocurrency my selection in cryptocurrency is Ethereum and my major thing is Twitter which is known for its social media platform. On glance project deals with how Twitter influencers influence the price of a cryptocurrency. Where cryptocurrency prices are determined by supply and demand. #ethereum is a limited number of tokens they can`t be increased on an increase in demand. Example: There are ten blue apples for instance and so many buyers out there want to buy them because they are limited and taste different than others, then they bit it who pay highest they will get it, so prices go high. Similarly, vice versa if no wants to buy it prices go down. So, Twitter is a platform influencer creating the interest in people to invest in cryptocurrency.
 My project aims to find the sentiment of Twitter influencer tweets on cryptocurrency.
 I used 37 deep learning models to find the correlation between Twitter tweets and cryptocurrency. I trained the model using 5 years of data and achieved 87% accuracy. When we examined the latest cryptocurrency result tweets, the result was 59.5%, 50% was like throwing a coin, but 9.5% could have some influence on the market by Twitter influencers. It means that there is. You can increase 59.5% by adding the latest cryptocurrency news as a feature set. I created an interactive dashboard and web service using a possible model for selecting the model to apply to the dataset and displaying the results on the dashboard.

Iâ€™m grateful to have the support of industry supervisor Seckin Tataroglu (CEO for Lambda BI), academic supervisor Sergei Petrovskii and DABI program director Andrew Morozov(Dr.), and my fellow teammates Surya Vamshi Manchukonda, Sanket Sontakke, Swetha Sri Pavuluri, and Avinash Rokkam on this wonderful journey.

The method of reviewing, cleansing, converting, and modelling data with the aim 
of finding valuable facts, informing results, and assisting decision-making is known 
as data analysis. Data analysis has many aspects and methods, encompassing a wide 
range of strategies under various names and being used in a number of industries, 
research, and social science domains. Data is king of today's business world.
In this project Data analysis is done in following steps:
1. Data warehouse
2. Data pre-processing
3. Implementation of model
4. Visualisation of results
5. Integration of model with real time data
