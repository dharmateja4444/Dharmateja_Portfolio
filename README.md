# [Project 1: Twitter Sentiment Analysis for cryptocurrency(Ethereum)](https://github.com/dharmateja4444/Twittersentimentianalyis-/blob/main/Dashboard.ipynb)

 This is my final project at the University of Leicester on Twitter sentiment analysis on cryptocurrency. I have been very exciting to work on trending technology like cryptocurrency my selection in cryptocurrency is Ethereum and other major thing is Twitter which is known for its social media platform. On glance project deals with how Twitter influencers influence the price of a cryptocurrency. Where cryptocurrency prices are determined by supply and demand. #ethereum is a limited number of tokens they can`t be increased on an increase in demand.Twitter is a platform influencer creating the interest in people to invest in cryptocurrency.
 My project aims to find the sentiment of Twitter influencer tweets on cryptocurrency.
 I used 37 deep learning models to find the correlation between Twitter tweets and cryptocurrency. I trained the model using 5 years of data and achieved 87% accuracy. When we examined the latest cryptocurrency result tweets, the result was 59.5%, 50% was like throwing a coin, but 9.5% could have some influence on the market by Twitter influencers. It means that there is. You can increase 59.5% by adding the latest cryptocurrency news as a feature set. I created an interactive dashboard and web service using a possible model for selecting the model to apply to the dataset and displaying the results on the dashboard.

Iâ€™m grateful to have the support of industry supervisor Seckin Tataroglu (CEO for Lambda BI), academic supervisor Sergei Petrovskii and DABI program director Andrew Morozov(Dr.), and my fellow teammates Surya Vamshi Manchukonda, Sanket Sontakke, Swetha Sri Pavuluri, and Avinash Rokkam on this wonderful journey.

In this project Data analysis is done in following steps:
1. Data warehouse
2. Data pre-processing
3. Implementation of  deep learning models
4. Visualisation of results using panel dashboard
5. Integration of model with azure cloud.


# [Project 2: Data Analytics for Clash Royale battles](https://github.com/dharmateja4444/Clash-Royale/blob/main/8V280L8VQ-clash-royale-da%20(1).csv)

This is a professional squad of people who compete against one other. Supercell developed and distributed Clash Royale, a free-to-play real-time strategy video game. This game combines features of the Tower Defense trading card game with a multiplayer online warfare arena. Clash Royale has gotten increasingly popular in recent years. The interface in Clash Royale games is fantastic, and you may play with humans instead of robots. Cooks, there's no need to wait for the last-second twist. They are constantly prepared to combat. It is possible to play with your buddies. Time You can also employ your own plan to surprise your opponents. Supercell used 3D modelling software and game programming to create this crash game. They compute information using the fast C++ programming language, and they employ the OpenGL graphics library to easily and quickly generate and integrate graphics.

2. Data pre-processing
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Implementation of model
5. Visualisation of results



# [Project 3: Data Analytics for E- Gaming(Clash of clans)](https://github.com/dharmateja4444/Data-Analytics-for-esports/blob/main/clash%20of%20clans.ipynb)

Players in Clash of Clans will be divided into clans, which will be leveled up in clan leagues. In essence, a clan league is a fight between two clans. In clan league, each clan member must choose an opponent team to combat and earn up to three stars. We use prior data to examine a player's statistics and estimate if we can win or lose the game. If the player is predicted to lose the game, we will offer suggestions for improvement.

# [Project 4: Data Analytics for League of Legends](https://github.com/dharmateja4444/lol/blob/main/3.Machine%20Learning.ipynb)

This is a multi-player online game in which 10 people compete in 5v5 battles. Predicting which side will win based on decisions a player can make before a match begins is the challenge I'm trying to tackle. Champion selections, summoner spells, and runes are all examples of this. There are now a number of programs that analyze post-match data to offer match statistics, estimate the optimal item combinations for a particular champion, and compute victory rates based on previous encounters. The idea is to transform this into a classification challenge using a data science technique. The goal is to leverage the player's prematch decisions as features.
