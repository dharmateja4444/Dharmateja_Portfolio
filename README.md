<h3>clash of clan war prediction</h3>

clan war prediction using keras machine learning library.

for this war prediction, I have collected datasets from the coc warlog.

1st half dataset - testing.

2nd half dataset - training

for training the neural network, you can use your own clan warlog data.
```
inputs for neural network:
1. clan Level
2. attacks
3. expEarned
4. teamSize
opponent clan:
5. clanLevel
 ```
outputs:
win = 1 or lose = 0.
